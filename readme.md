# NCryptor: The Future

So this is where the idea begins: you and your friends are roleplaying vigilante hackers and keep exchanging confidential information to each other. The messages however, as simple as they might look, could shake the economy and politics of several nations worldwide. If a third party (most probably your parents) accidentally or intentionally step upon them, it's over for your secret society of two members. Therefore, instead of rawly communicating through whatever messaging app you've been using, you turn to NCryptor.

## How this works? 

You both download this software.

You ignore the malware notification Windows Defender shows you during installation (trust me on this).

You continue anyway.

You select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt.
(Encrypt: Message to secret code; Decrypt: Secret code to message)

You click on Encrypt.

You enter the message.

You copy the generated code.

You text the code to your friend.

Your friend copies the code.

He clicks on Decrypt.

He pastes the code.

He reads the messages.

**Ultimate end-to-end communication unlocked**
